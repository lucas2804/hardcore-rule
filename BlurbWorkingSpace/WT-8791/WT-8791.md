1) As I have debugged on database. Currently we have 226 users will encounter SBH on production. 

- We have no constraint data between api_products.api_key_id and api_keys.id
- We have no soft delete for api_keys table, so we can not track when api_keys(58, 71) was deleted. 

2) My possible solution is ignore and does not display invalid products on my/dashboard page.
